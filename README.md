# DSE Toolbox

A set of tools (parsers, converters, diff tools, references) I regularly use at work, combined into a single app.

## Development

yarn
yarn start
```

## Building

```
yarn run dist
```

Binary will be available in the `dist/` directory.

## Download

You can download the latest binary at [Releases](https://github.com/thameera/toolbox/releases) page.
